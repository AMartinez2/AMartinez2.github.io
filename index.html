        I started studying piano and music theory when I was four years old
        and eventually went on to pick up many more instruments. Through music,
        I was given several leadership and international performance
        opportunities. At some point, I started learning about film, digital
        editing, and graphic design. This lead to freelance work with local
        businesses, creating advertisement flyers and internet marketing
        material during high school. My first exposure to programming came when
        working with Adobe After Effects' expression commands. A few years
        later, I was one of the first students in my High School's history to
        form and enroll in an AP computer science course. My study and practice
        of computer science continues to this day.

          I worked in a team to develop a solution that allowed salespeople to
          easily access relevant data replacing previous system that forced
          salespeople to login to multiple systems. The old system consisted of
          an ElasticSearch database and a Salesforce database. A sales person
          would have to log on to both systems and cross check account
          information by manually matching account IDs. The solution I developed
          was an Odata Client that allowed the ElasticSearch data to seamlessly
          appear in the Salesforce client. This solution saves employees hours a
          week by streamlining their work flows. I also developed an
          administration control system for the Odata Client allowing company
          admins to maintain and add functionality to the client.
